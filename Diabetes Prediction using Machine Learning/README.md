🤖 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using diagnostic health data. It covers the full ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment, and features an interactive web application built with Streamlit.

📊 Project Highlights:
Based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Implements classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM

Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Developed an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Streamlit for web-based user interface

🎯 Objective:
To build and deploy a user-friendly machine learning model that assists in the early detection of diabetes, combining technical skills with practical healthcare applications.
